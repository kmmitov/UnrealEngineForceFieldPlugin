# UnrealEngineForceFieldPlugin
A force field plugin project for the Game Engine Architecture class at FMI, Sofia University

The ForceField plugin will add support for force fields in Unreal - entities within the game world which 
apply a custom function to any game object entering them and can optionally apply a function to the object upon its leaving them.
The plugin will allow creation and placement of such objects in the game world; 
provide a sufficient number of already implemented functions which can be combined to achieve a multitude of common effects
such as time dilation, reflection shield, tractor beam etc,as well as the ability to add a custom function to answer user needs;
allow customizations of various properties such as lifespan, affected volume, etc;
allow visualization of forcefields.
